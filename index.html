<h1>OUR DIVINE IDENTITY</h1>

<div class="quote">
    <p>“Much of the confusion we experience in this life comes from simply not understanding who we are. Too many go about their lives thinking they are less than they are. But if you only understood who you are and what is in store for you, your heart would overflow with such gratitude and happiness that it would enlighten even the darkest sorrows with the light and love of God.”</p>
    <p class="source">- President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, <em>The Reflection in the Water</em>, November 1, 2009.</p>

<div class="quote">
    <p>“Understanding God’s and our divine identities is the vital foundation for happiness and success, as well as for avoiding the identity and purpose crisis we see around us…that divine, spiritual DNA of Almighty God flows in each of His children. Never forget you were ‘reared to spiritual maturity in the mansions of the Father,’ and that it is His greatest desire for you to fulfill your divine destiny and return home to Him.”</p>

<div class="quote">
    <p>“Righteousness and faith certainly are instrumental in healing the sick, deaf, and lame—if such healing accomplishes God’s purposes and is in accordance with His will. Thus, even if we have strong faith, many mountains will not be moved. And not all of the sick and infirm will be healed.”</p>

However, He will not enter without invitation.”</p>

<div class="quote">
    <p>“Healing blessings come in many ways, each suited to our individual needs, as known to Him who loves us best. Sometimes a ‘healing’ cures our illness or lifts our burden.

<h1>Faith to be Healed</h1>
